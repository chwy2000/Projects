Weighed down
Weighed down on the way down

I've lived behind a mask so long, so few know who I am
They know other sides of me that hide behind a haunted man

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They've saved me from myself
And they stand by me

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the comedowns
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, way down

I'll fight fatigue, I'll fight for you
For everything that we've been through
I'll take your hand, I'll carry on
I've been weighed down for far too long

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They save me from myself
And they stand by me, stand by me

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the comedowns
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, way down

I won't be weighed down
There's too much resting on this
Never be weighed down
I'll fucking stand and resist
